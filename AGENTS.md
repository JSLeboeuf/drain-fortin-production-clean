## Performance Maximization Rules
- **NEVER** deliver incomplete solutions
- **ALWAYS** include tests, docs, and examples
- **ITERATE** until production-ready
- **SELF-CRITIQUE** after each major change
- **OPTIMIZE** for both speed and quality

## Project Context
This is a [PROJECT_TYPE] using [TECH_STACK].
Success = shipped, tested, documented code.

## Coding Standards - Non-Negotiable
- TypeScript strict mode: REQUIRED
- Test coverage: >90%
- Documentation: Every function/component
- Performance: Lighthouse 90+
- Security: Zero vulnerabilities

## Iteration Protocol
1. Generate initial solution
2. Self-review and identify improvements
3. Implement optimizations
4. Test thoroughly
5. Document completely
6. Repeat until perfect

## Success Metrics
- Code compiles without errors
- All tests pass
- Documentation is complete
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security audit clean
