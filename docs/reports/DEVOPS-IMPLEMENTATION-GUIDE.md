# DevOps Implementation Guide - Drain Fortin Production System

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive DevOps setup transforms the Drain Fortin Production System from a basic deployment to a fully automated, monitored, and scalable enterprise-grade infrastructure. The implementation includes CI/CD pipelines, containerization, Infrastructure as Code, comprehensive monitoring, and automated backup strategies.

## Current Infrastructure Assessment

### ✅ Existing Strengths
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript, Supabase cloud backend
- **Version Control**: Git repository with clean structure
- **Environment Management**: Basic .env configuration
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with comprehensive test coverage
- **Build Optimization**: Vite with optimized bundle (95.95KB)

### ❌ Critical Gaps Addressed
- **No CI/CD Pipeline** → GitHub Actions with automated testing and deployment
- **No Containerization** → Docker with multi-stage builds and security hardening
- **No Infrastructure as Code** → Terraform with Vercel, Cloudflare, and secrets management
- **No Monitoring** → Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and business metrics
- **No Automated Backup** → PowerShell scripts with database and configuration backup
- **No Security Scanning** → OWASP ZAP, CodeQL, dependency vulnerability checks
- **No Performance Monitoring** → Lighthouse, CDN optimization, real-time alerting

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**File**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

```yaml

```

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

**Files**: `infrastructure/terraform/`

```hcl
# Managed Resources:

- Business metrics (call volume, conversion rates)
- External service monitoring (Supabase, VAPI, Twilio)
- SSL certificate expiry tracking
```

**File**: `monitoring/alerts/application.yml`

```yaml
# Critical alerts configured:
- Frontend/backend downtime (2-minute threshold)
- High error rates (>10% for 5 minutes)
- P1 emergency calls unprocessed (1-minute threshold)
- SSL certificate expiry (30-day warning)
- Revenue drop detection (20% decrease)
```

### 5. Automated Backup System
