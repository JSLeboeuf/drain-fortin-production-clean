## Performance Recommendations

### **High Priority** (Immediate)
1. **Optimize Chart Bundle**
   ```typescript
   // Current: 381KB CallsChart bundle
   // Recommended: Split into smaller components
   const LazyChart = lazy(() => import('./ChartComponent'));
   ```

2. **Implement Critical Path Optimization**
   - Preload essential components
   - Inline critical route CSS
   - Optimize first meaningful paint

### **Medium Priority** (Next Sprint)
3. **Production Monitoring**
   - Add Web Vitals tracking
   - Implement performance budgets
   - Bundle size monitoring in CI/CD

4. **Advanced Caching**
   - Optimize Supabase query patterns
   - Implement background sync
   - Progressive data loading

### **Low Priority** (Future)
5. **Enhanced Features**
   - Virtual scrolling for large tables
   - Progressive image loading
   - Advanced PWA features (push notifications)
