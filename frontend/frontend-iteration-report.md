### 4. **Accessibility Hook** ♿
Comprehensive accessibility utilities:
- **Keyboard vs Mouse detection**
- **Screen reader announcements**
- **Focus trap management**
- **Skip links helper**
- **Arrow key navigation**
- **ARIA props generator**
- **Live regions** for dynamic content
- **Motion preferences** detection

**Usage:**
```javascript
const {
  isKeyboardUser,
  prefersReducedMotion,
  announce,
  setupFocusTrap,
  handleArrowNavigation
} = useAccessibility();
```
