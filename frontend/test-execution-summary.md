## 🔧 Issues Identified & Status

### Issue 1: New Test Failures (Expected) ⚠️
**Status**: Expected behavior  
**Reason**: Tests are validating APIs that don't exist yet  
**Solution**: Need to implement the actual hook functions  

**Failing Tests**:
- `useThrottledState` - API mismatch
- `usePersistentState` - Return value structure differs
- `useAsyncState` - Missing execute function

### Issue 2: Type Guard Test Syntax Error ❌
**Status**: Needs fix  
**File**: `src/types/guards.test.ts:1:100`  
**Error**: Comment block formatting issue  
**Solution**: Fixed similar issue in useOptimizedState test

### Issue 3: Low Coverage Critical ❌
**Current**: 5.49% overall coverage  
**Target**: 80% minimum  
**Gap**: 50+ untested custom hooks and utilities
