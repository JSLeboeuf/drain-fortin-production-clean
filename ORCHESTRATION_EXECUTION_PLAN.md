## ðŸ“Š RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX

| Domain | Risk Level | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Security | ðŸ”´ HIGH | Data breach, compliance violation | Immediate secret rotation, automated scanning |
| Quality | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM | Production bugs, user experience issues | Comprehensive test execution, coverage validation |
| Deployment | ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM | Service downtime, rollback required | Staged deployment, smoke testing |
| Monitoring | ðŸŸ¢ LOW | Reduced observability | Graceful degradation, manual monitoring |

## ðŸŽ¯ OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES

**Parallelization Gains:**
- Security Domain: 60% time reduction (18 min â†’ 7 min for parallel tasks)
- Quality Domain: 45% time reduction (independent test suites)
- Deployment Domain: 30% time reduction (parallel validation tasks)

**Resource Allocation:**
- CPU-intensive: Build processes, test execution
- Network-intensive: API key generation, deployment
- Memory-intensive: Type checking, large bundle processing

**Bottleneck Mitigation:**
- Pre-cache dependencies during security phase
- Parallel test execution with isolated databases  
- Streaming deployment with health checks
